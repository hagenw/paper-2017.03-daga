Repository for the paper "Wissenschaftliche Erkenntnis, Reproduzierbarkeit und
praktische Lösungen in der Akustik" presented at the [annual meeting (DAGA) of
the German acoustical society (DEGA), 2017, Kiel,
Germany](http://www.daga2017.de/).

This repository contains [the talk](talk.pdf) and [its sources](talk/).

There is no companion paper available, but you might have a look at the paper
[Towards Open Science in Acoustics: Foundations and Best
Practices](https://github.com/spatialaudio/DAGA2017_towards_open_science_in_acoustics/blob/master/paper_towards_open_science_in_acoustics.pdf)
from our other contribution to this topic.

The following literature is worth reading to get ideas about the scientific
method, problems of the *P* value and possible solutions to the reproducibility
crisis:

* [Lewens, *The Meaning of Science*, Pelican, 2015](https://www.pelicanbooks.com/the-meaning-of-science/)
* [Halsey, et al., *The fickle P value generates irreproducible results*, Nature Methods, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3288)
