Repository for the paper "Wissenschaftliche Erkenntnis, Reproduzierbarkeit und
praktische Lösungen in der Akustik" presented at the [annual meeting (DAGA) of
the German acoustical society (DEGA), 2017, Kiel,
Germany](http://www.daga2017.de/).

This repository contains [the talk](talk.pdf) and [its sources](talk/).  There
is no companion paper available, but you might have a look at the [paper Towards
Open Science in Acoustics: Foundations and Best
Practices](https://github.com/spatialaudio/DAGA2017_towards_open_science_in_acoustics/blob/master/paper_towards_open_science_in_acoustics.pdf)
of our other contribution to this topic.

For an introduction to the topic of science and the scientific method it might
be worth reading [Lewens, *The Meaning of Science*, Pelican,
2015](https://www.pelicanbooks.com/the-meaning-of-science/). For a discussion of
reproducibility problems with the *P* value, have a look at [Halsey, et al.,
*The fickle P value generates irreproducible results*, Nature Methods,
2015](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3288). An holistic coverage of the problems
and possible solutions of the current reproducibility crisis is given in the
nice report [*Reproducibility and reliability of biomedical research: improving
research practice* by the Academy of Medical
Sciences](http://apo.org.au/node/58335).
